# ROMTool

Hello everyone!  I'm Wesley Wilson, with Tiny Phoenix, and I want to talk a bit about a neat little tool I made for Maya using Python.  I call it the "Range of Motion" tool.  As for what it does: the name tells it all, really!  This tool makes a simple range of motion animation that allows quick feedback during skinning.  You select a joint from the selection menu showing all the joints in your scene, and then you can set keyframes for the rotations and/or the translates to get an idea of how the mesh will deform around that joint.
